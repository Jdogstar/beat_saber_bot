# beat_saber_bot
Checks the beat saber mod site every time I log in (as I have it set to run on startup) in order to tell me when the mod has finally caught up with the current game version

I'm going to be frank, this is super uber niche, so unless there's somehow demand for this, I don't care to add a readme lol, if the current reader wants me too, they can
comment and I'll upload a better readme
